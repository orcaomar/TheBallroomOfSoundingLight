A quark is an elementary particle and a fundamental
constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form 
composite particles called hadrons, the most stable 
of which are protons and neutrons, the components 
of atomic nuclei. Due to a phenomenon known as color
confinement, quarks are never found in isolation; 
they can only be found within hadrons. For this 
reason, much of what is known about quarks has 
been drawn from observations of the hadrons 
themselves.
