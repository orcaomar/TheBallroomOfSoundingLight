SOFTWARE PREREQUISITES

You must have Processing installed. If you want to modify the code on the Arduino (see the Spectrum_Analyzer_LED_control directory) then you must install the Arduino DisplayDuino 744 environment. See http://mondomatrix.com/info/?page_id=364

INSTALLATION

Before you can run the Processing code, you need to install a number of libraries in your Processing/libraries directory (Processing creates this directory when it first run). Copy the directories labeled 'guicomponents' and 'promidi' from the 'external' directory into your Processing 'libraries' directory.

Finally, if you run on OS X, you will need to install the mmj midi library. Open mmj.zip and read the readme.txt to understand the nuances of installing this software.
